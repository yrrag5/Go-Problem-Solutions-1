Q4 - Factorial sum

Finds the factorial number 100! using a 64 bit intger.

Q5 - Guessing game 

User guesses a number between 1 and 100, while guessTaken counter is incremented after each attempt with a tally of the amount of attempts when the user guesses correctly at the end of the program. Will not increment a repeated guess.

# Conclusion

I adapted alot of work from browsing through the web and have a link on the top of my code in each file of the URL that helped me come to realization of a solution to each question. Im still discovering the GO programming language and hopefully through the module Data Representation and Query, I can become more comfortable in the language.
